## Connect your buttons

You will need four buttons, each wired to separate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

Wire each button to a different numbered GPIO pin. You can choose any pins you like, but you will need to remember the numbers.

Wire a single **GND** pin to the negative **blue** rail on the breadboard. Then, wire one leg of each button to this rail. Finally, wire the remaining legs of the buttons to individual GPIO pins.

Here's a wiring diagram that might help. In the example, the remaining legs of the buttons are wired to **GPIO 4**, **GPIO 17**, **GPIO 27** and **GPIO 10**.
