## Improve your script

The code that you have written should work without any problems. However, it's generally a good idea to make your code a bit cleaner once you have a prototype that works.

The next steps are completely optional. If you're happy with your script, then just leave it as it is. If you want to make your script a bit cleaner, then follow the steps on this page.

You can store your button objects and sounds in a dictionary, instead of having to create eight different objects.

Have a look at the steps below to learn about creating basic dictionaries and then looping over them.

First, create a dictionary that uses the `Button`s as keys and the `Sound`s as values.

```python3
button_sounds = {Button(4): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_tom_mid_hard.wav"),
                 Button(17): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_cymbal_hard.wav"),
                 Button(27): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_snare_hard.wav"),
                 Button(10): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_cowbell.wav")}
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You can now loop over the dictionary to tell the program to play the sound when the button is pressed:
```python
for button, sound in button_sounds.items():
    button.when_pressed = sound.play
```

--- /task ---

```python
import pygame
from gpiozero import Button

pygame.init()

button_sounds = {Button(4): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_tom_mid_hard.wav"),
                 Button(17): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_cymbal_hard.wav"),
                 Button(27): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_snare_hard.wav"),
                 Button(10): pygame.mixer.Sound("drum_cowbell.wav")}

for button, sound in button_sounds.items():
    button.when_pressed = sound.play
```
